    - LUT - apply color correction overlay to the whole scene. Comes with 2 LUT filter examples.

Following is the explanation of all the  assets included in this package:

1. baseBeauty DeepAR Studio file - all basic beauty elements that are described above are setup in this Studio file. It should be used as a basis for each new beauty look. Users should just change parameters on different materials like textures and/or colors.

2. FbxModels folder - includes all .fbx models used in the baseBeauty file:
    - faceBeauty - a 3D model that covers the user's face on which foundation effects are applied. In baseBeauty it uses BeautyFree shader which already implements slots for foundation and smoothing:
        - alpha mask defining the area of effect for foundation makeup
        - Foundation color - which color is applied as the foundation makeup color. Alpha can be used to modify the intensity.
    - eyes.fbx - this model is used for eyeshadow and eyeliner effects. It is a flat model that covers the area around the eyes up to eyebrows. It is resized as the eyebrows are moving which makes this model especially good to apply eyeshadow.
    - eyes2.fbx - the same model as eyes.fbx but does not resize with eyebrows movement, meaning the area it covers around the eyes is static and does not deform with eyebrows movement. This makes it good to use for eyelashes effect.
    - lips.fbx - an .fbx model used to track user's lips. Used to apply lipstick colors.

3. Looks folder - contains 2 beauty/makeup looks (DeepAR Studio file) created with various assets included in this package (look1 and look2)

4. Shaders - contains beauty shader that is used to apply foundation effects on the face.

5. Textures - most of the beauty features are applied via different textures, either as an alpha mask or as a diffuse texture.
